# gen_poly
This is the simplest generic genetic algorithm for finding the roots of polynomial.

The goal is to maximize (x1*x2*x3*x4*x5) / (x6*x7*x8*x9*x10), 1 ≤ xi ≤ 10 using the genetic algorithm. User also can specify the population size, number of generations, number of mutate points and the size of tournament (for tournament selection).
